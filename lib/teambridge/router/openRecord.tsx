/**
 * Opening a Teambridge record's detail panel from inside an app.
 *
 * Apps do not build their own record detail modal — the Teambridge host owns
 * it. `?rid=<recordId>` on the app's own URL is what the host watches for:
 * `TBRouter` posts the app-local path *including the query string* to the
 * parent frame, the parent mirrors it into its own URL, and the host's record
 * detail container opens that record.
 *
 * The URL is changed with the History API rather than the router, because
 * nothing on the server reads `rid`. A `<Link>` or `router.push` to the same
 * route with a different query string is still a route navigation: Next
 * re-renders the whole page on the server (re-running every Teambridge read on
 * it) and only updates the URL once that commits, ~0.5s later, for an
 * identical page. Next keeps `useSearchParams` in sync with `pushState`, so
 * TBRouter still sees the change and tells the parent.
 *
 * Re-opening the same record clears `rid` first and sets it again, rather than
 * writing the same URL twice. Two things have to change for the panel to
 * reopen:
 *
 *  - TBRouter only tells the host about a path that *differs* from the last
 *    one it advertised, so writing an identical URL posts nothing.
 *  - The host only reacts when `rid` changes. Dismissing a panel by clicking
 *    away leaves the host still holding that `rid`, so a message carrying the
 *    same one is ignored. (Saving clears it, which is why "close by saving"
 *    and "close by clicking off" behave differently if you only test one.)
 *
 * Clearing and re-setting satisfies both, given two details:
 *
 *  - The two writes must land in separate React commits, or they coalesce and
 *    the cleared state is never advertised — hence `useCommitCount`.
 *  - The cleared URL carries a nonce (`ridClear`). Without it the cleared path
 *    can be character-for-character the path TBRouter last *received* from the
 *    host, which its echo suppression drops.
 *
 * Test any change here by opening, closing (both by saving and by clicking
 * away) and reopening the same record several times — including after the
 * component that holds the link has unmounted and remounted.
