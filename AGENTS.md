# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, v0, Cursor, etc.) and human contributors working on apps built from this template.

## What this template is

A Next.js starter for apps embedded inside the Teambridge interface (iframe). All apps built from this template should look and feel like Teambridge by following the **Alloy design system** — replicated locally via Tailwind tokens + shadcn/ui (no runtime dependency on the Alloy package).

## ⚠️ Example code — replace before shipping a real app

These files exist only as a working demonstration of how to read Teambridge data and render it with the design system. Treat them as scaffolding to learn from, not a foundation to build on:

- `app/page.tsx` — sample shifts dashboard (file required by Next.js — replace its contents, don't delete the file)
- `app/create-shift-modal.tsx` — sample modal (delete or replace)
- `app/actions.ts` — sample server action (delete or replace)

When the user starts building their actual app, **replace this content** before adding real features. Don't extend the demo — start fresh from these files.

The Teambridge integration in `lib/teambridge/`, the API route handlers in `app/api/teambridge/`, the layout in `app/layout.tsx`, the styling in `app/globals.css`, and the shadcn components in `components/ui/` are all part of the template and should be kept.

## Navigation & data fetching

Apps render inside the Teambridge proxy at `https://api.teambridge.com/apps/<slug>/…`. Next.js's `basePath` config (set in `next.config.ts` from the `APP_SLUG` env var) tells the framework about the prefix, so the routing primitives all handle it automatically — `<Link>`, `useRouter`, `redirect`, and `usePathname` from `next/link` and `next/navigation` work the way you'd expect, and you write app-local paths (`/dashboards/123`, not `/apps/<slug>/dashboards/123`).

```tsx
// ✓ on-template — write paths relative to your app, Next adds the prefix
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useRouter, redirect } from 'next/navigation';

const router = useRouter();
router.push('/dashboards/123');                // navigates to /apps/<slug>/dashboards/123
redirect('/dashboards/789');                   // server actions
<Link href="/reports/456">View report</Link>
```

**The one exception is `fetch`.** Native `fetch` doesn't honor `basePath`, so a bare `fetch('/api/dashboards')` hits `/api/dashboards` instead of `/apps/<slug>/api/dashboards` and 404s through the proxy. Use `tbFetch` from `@/lib/teambridge` for same-origin requests. ESLint will error on bare `fetch` calls.

```tsx
import { tbFetch } from '@/lib/teambridge';

await tbFetch('/api/dashboards');              // prepends /apps/<slug>
```

In dev mode (`TB_DEV_MODE=true`), `basePath` is empty and `tbFetch` is a no-op — paths pass through unchanged. The prefix is derived at build time from `APP_SLUG` and inlined into the client bundle via `NEXT_PUBLIC_TB_APP_BASE_PATH` (also accessible via the `TB_APP_BASE_PATH` export from `@/lib/teambridge`) for the rare cases where you need to construct a same-origin URL manually.

A few cases to be careful with manually:

- Raw `<a href="/foo">` and `<form action="/foo">` — `basePath` only applies to Next.js's own primitives. For native HTML, prepend the prefix yourself with `tbPath()` if the URL needs to be same-origin.
- Self-fetching your own route handlers from a server component. Don't; call the underlying logic directly instead (per [Vercel's guidance](https://vercel.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-the-next-js-app-router-and-how-to-fix-them)).
- `lib/teambridge/client/TBClient.ts` deliberately uses raw `fetch` — it talks to external Teambridge APIs at absolute URLs, not to your app's own routes.

## Design system rules

### Use shadcn primitives, not hand-rolled HTML

Buttons, inputs, dialogs, tables, alerts, etc. live in `components/ui/`. They're already styled to match Alloy. Reaching for raw `<button>` or `<input>` with custom Tailwind drifts off-system and forces inconsistency across apps.

```tsx
// ✓ on-system
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
<Button>Save</Button>

// ✗ drift
<button className="bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 rounded text-white">Save</button>
```

To add primitives the template doesn't already include:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <name>
```

Already installed: `alert`, `avatar`, `badge`, `button`, `card`, `checkbox`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `input`, `label`, `popover`, `radio-group`, `scroll-area`, `select`, `separator`, `skeleton`, `sonner`, `switch`, `table`, `tabs`, `textarea`, `tooltip`.

### Colors

Two namespaces, both already wired into Tailwind:

**Semantic aliases (preferred for surfaces and text)** — adapt to light/dark automatically:

| Class | Use for |
|---|---|
| `bg-background` / `text-foreground` | Page surface and primary text |
| `bg-card` / `text-card-foreground` | Card surface |
| `bg-popover` / `text-popover-foreground` | Floating menus, tooltips |
| `bg-primary` / `text-primary-foreground` | Primary action (Alloy blue) |
| `bg-secondary` / `text-secondary-foreground` | Secondary surface |
| `bg-muted` / `text-muted-foreground` | Recessed surface, supporting text |
| `bg-accent` / `text-accent-foreground` | Hover / selected state |
| `bg-destructive` / `text-destructive-foreground` | Destructive action (Alloy red) |
| `border-border`, `border-input`, `ring-ring` | Borders, input edges, focus ring |

**Alloy palette (for color accents — badges, charts, status tags)**:

`blue`, `azure`, `purple`, `pink`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `matcha`, `green`, `slate`, `grey`/`gray`. Each has stops `50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 850, 900, 950`. Examples: `bg-azure-500`, `text-matcha-700`, `border-purple-200`.

`gray` is aliased to Alloy `grey`. `gray-*` and `grey-*` resolve to the same value.

Do not introduce new hex values in component code. If you find a need for a color outside this palette, raise it — the design system needs to grow rather than be bypassed.

Direct CSS variable access for places where utilities aren't a fit: `var(--color-content-secondary)`, `var(--color-bg-tertiary)`, `var(--color-border-opaque)`, etc. (defined in `app/globals.css`).

### Spacing

4 px scale. Tailwind's defaults already match Alloy: `p-1` = 4 px, `p-2` = 8 px, `p-4` = 16 px. Stay on this scale; don't introduce arbitrary values like `px-[7px]`.

### Border radius

| Class | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `rounded-button` | 6 px | Buttons, inputs, selects, textareas (Alloy convention) |
| `rounded-sm` | 4 px | Inset elements (menu items, etc.) |
| `rounded-md` | 8 px | General surfaces |
| `rounded-lg` | 12 px | Cards, dialogs, alerts |
| `rounded-xl` | 16 px | Large cards |
| `rounded-2xl` | 24 px | Hero surfaces |
| `rounded-full` | pill | Avatars, badges, switches, status dots |

### Shadows

Use `shadow-sm` / `shadow-md` / `shadow-lg` (mapped to Alloy `below-low` / `below-md` / `below-high`). For shadows projecting upward (toasts, bottom sheets), use `shadow-above-low` / `shadow-above-md` / `shadow-above-high`.

### Charts

Use the `Chart*` primitives from `components/ui/chart.tsx` (Recharts under the hood). Reference series colors via `var(--chart-1)` through `var(--chart-5)` in your `ChartConfig` — these map to Alloy's default chart palette (blue, green, yellow, red, purple). Don't reach for raw hex values or pick arbitrary palette stops.

### Typography

Geist (sans) and Geist Mono are the only sanctioned faces — already loaded via `next/font` in `app/layout.tsx`. Use `font-mono` for IDs / code, default sans everywhere else. Don't introduce other fonts.

Type scale: Tailwind defaults (`text-xs` 12 px → `text-7xl` 96 px) match Alloy.

### Icons

Use `lucide-react`. Import the **`Icon`-suffixed** names to match the convention shadcn uses internally:

```tsx
import { CalendarDaysIcon, UserIcon, AlertTriangleIcon } from 'lucide-react';

<UserIcon className="size-4 text-muted-foreground" />
```

Default size in shadcn buttons / alerts / badges is `size-4` (16 px). Use `size-3.5` inside small chips, `size-5` for prominent action icons.

Don't hand-roll inline `<svg>` icons — lucide covers the same coverage as Alloy's icon set.

### Dark mode

`.dark` class on `<html>` flips all semantic aliases automatically. Don't write `dark:` variants for surface colors — they're handled. Only add `dark:` overrides when a specific element needs different behavior than the semantic token implies (rare).

### Iframe context

Apps render inside an iframe within Teambridge. Keep this in mind:

- No top-level nav, app shell, or breadcrumbs — Teambridge owns those.
- Default to full width. Constrain to a max-width (e.g., `max-w-6xl`) only inside main content containers, not at the page root.
- Don't set `min-h-screen` on the body. The iframe sizes itself.
- Background on the page should be `bg-background` (Alloy white), not a colored hero. The host already provides chrome.

## Data access

All app data — shifts, users, jobs, placements, anything — lives in **collections** (custom data tables). Every read and write goes through the Unified Collections API: `client.collections.list()`, `client.collections.getFields(id)`, `client.collections.records.{list,get,create,update}`. The full canonical workflow with examples lives in README → "Using the API Client". The notes below cover gotchas that have tripped up agents in practice.

### API constraints

- **Page size limit**: `records.list` enforces a max of **50 records per page** (default 20). Never request more in a single call. To fetch all records, loop with `pageSize: 50`, incrementing `page` (0-indexed), until either `data.length < pageSize` or you've consumed `totalCount`.

### Collection name matching

Match by **exact, case-insensitive equality** — never `includes()` or other partial matching. Accounts often have additional collections whose names contain the substring you want (e.g. `"Shifts Group"`, `"Archived Users"`); a partial match grabs whichever appears first.

```ts
// ✓ Exact, case-insensitive
const shifts = collections.find((c) => c.name.toLowerCase() === 'shifts');

// ✗ Partial — silently picks "Shifts Group" or similar
const shifts = collections.find((c) => c.name.toLowerCase().includes('shift'));
```

### Record field mapping

Records come back **keyed by field UUID, not by semantic property name**. There is no `record.locationId` or `record.startTime` — only `record["<uuid>"]`. The workflow:

1. Fetch field definitions: `const fields = await client.collections.getFields(collectionId)`.
2. Look up each field by name (exact, case-insensitive): `const locationField = fields.find((f) => f.name.toLowerCase() === 'location')`.
3. Read the value via the field's `id`: `const locationId = locationField ? record[locationField.id] : null`.

```ts
// ✓ Look up the field, then index by its id
const fields = await client.collections.getFields(shiftsCollection.id);
const locationField = fields.find((f) => f.name.toLowerCase() === 'location');
const locationId = locationField ? record[locationField.id] : null;

// ✗ Records have no semantic keys — this is always undefined
const locationId = record.locationId;
```

**Reference fields** (e.g. `Location` on a Shift, `Assignee` linking to Users) store the **record ID** of the related record, not its display name. To render names, fetch the related collection's records, build a `recordId → name` map keyed by that collection's name fields (e.g. `First Name` + `Last Name` on Users), and look up by ID at render time. The `app/page.tsx` demo does this for the Assignee column — copy that pattern.

## Project structure

```
app/
  layout.tsx          # Root layout, TBProvider wired in
  page.tsx            # ⚠ Example — replace
  globals.css         # Alloy tokens + Tailwind theme bridge — keep
  api/teambridge/
    install/route.ts  # Lifecycle webhook
    uninstall/route.ts
components/ui/        # shadcn primitives (own them, edit freely)
lib/
  teambridge/         # Teambridge integration — keep
  utils.ts            # cn() helper
middleware.ts         # Request validation
```

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Adding hex colors or `text-[#...]` arbitrary values. Use the tokens.
- Using `<button>` / `<input>` directly instead of shadcn's `Button` / `Input`.
- Importing fonts other than Geist.
- Editing `app/globals.css` to inject app-specific colors. Extend the Alloy palette there only with semantic justification.
- Treating `app/page.tsx` as the starting point of a real app instead of replacing it.
- Adding `dark:` variants for surface colors that the semantic tokens already handle.
- Setting `min-h-screen` on root containers (breaks iframe sizing).

## When in doubt

If a component or pattern doesn't have a shadcn equivalent already in this template, prefer composing it from existing primitives over reaching for new dependencies. When stuck on visual choices, lean on the semantic tokens (`bg-muted`, `text-muted-foreground`, etc.) — they're calibrated to match Alloy without you needing to remember the exact values.
